1. Introduction
–––––––––––––––

Perceived Information Quality (PIQ) can influence:
   1. perceived risk
   2. trust
   3. intention to use the exchange (i.e. method for)

PIQ is incrementally influenced by:
   1. control transparency
   2. outcome feedback

Motivation:
- I-O electronic exchange is important and brings efficiency
- but, different quality in existing companies
- this can affect user adoption of EDI!!

How literature has addresses the problem:
   - data exchange is a IOS (interoganizational system)
   - IOS is a part of IOR (interorganizational relationships)
   Three main themes in literature:
      1. relationships (critical!)
      2. uncertainty (must be mitigated either by the IOR itself or through set up strutures)
      3. time matters (- exchange patterns => + time)


2. Literature review (theoretical background) 
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––-

 1. State of the Art
 -------------------

   a. Literature attention on the benefits of IOS
   b. Economics researchers have studied *factors* that influence IOS adoption. E.g. incentives induce IOS adoption
   c. Sociological researchers have focused on networks and social relations that influence IOS adoption. Suggestion: similarity, trust, reputation, past alliances, third-party ties, and interdependence lead to IOS adoption.
   d. Interdisciplinary studies integrate existing theories in a model of IOR fomation. Results: theorie bases address uncertainty via joint actions, information exchange, and coordination.
   e. Implication of existing theory is that *trust* and *perceived risk* are two crucial factors for managing uncertainty in I-O exchanges.
   f. Lesson learnt from literature: early relationship cues play a role (Gulati and Gargiulo, 1999) and relationship uncertainty has to be addressed by trust and other factors. Summing up, trust and risk are important to IOS adoption.

 2. Model Overview
 -----------------

 Picture (fig. 1):
 - Perceived risk and trust are antecedents to Intention to use the exchange (i.e. IOS adoption)
 - Role of PIQ and two of its antecedents

 3. PIQ and Information Sytems Design
 ------------------------------------

 PIQ defined as 
 the user's reaction to the characteristicts of output information versus
 the user's information requirements

 PIQ is a mean of
   - cognitive beliefs about favorable or unfavorable characteristics
   - accuracy
   - completeness
   - relevance
 of the exchange information.


 4. Antecedents of PIQ
 ---------------------
   a. Control transparency:
      availability of adequate information to verify or assess the data exchange.
   b. Outcome feedback:
      availability (offered by a provider) of the information needed to control the exchange outcomes

   H1: PIQ is higher when control transparency is high
   H2: PIQ is higher when outcome feedback is high

 5. Direct effects of PIQ
 ------------------------

 6. Direct determinants of Intention to Use
 ------------------------------------------

 7. Relationship Between Trusting Beliefs and Perceived Risk
 -----------------------------------------------------------

 8. Mediation of PIQ by Perceived Risk and Trusting Beliefs
